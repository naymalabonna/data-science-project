### Repository Structure
- `data`
  - `train.json`: The training set containing recipes id, type of cuisine, and list of ingredients.
  - `test.json`: The test set containing recipes id, and list of ingredients.
  - `cleaned.json`: The cleaned and combined dataset for modeling. (chile.....delete this)
  - `data_dictionary.json`: The data dictionary for cleaned.

- `code`
  - `etl_recipes.py`: Cleans `train.json` and `test.json`, returns cleaned list of ingredients.
  - `exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`: Includes descriptive statistics and charts.
  - `build_model.py`: Builds Neural Network model. (yet to be added)

### Exploratory Analysis
Describe what work you have done so far and include the code.
For exploratory analysis, we explored the main characteristics of the data including the total number of recipes, cuisines, and
number of unique ingredients. Number of recipes for each cuisine
total number of recipes, cuisines, and ingredients
number of unique ingredients
total number of recipes, total number of recipes per cuisine
total number of ingredients, total number of ingredients per ingredient 
number of unique ingredients

### Challenges
