# What's Cooking?

Have you ever wondered where the food you eat everyday comes from? Have you ever thought about how every part of the world eats their own distinct type of food? Eating is an essential part of life, culture, and nationality. The dishes we eat have their own identity and are tied to a lineage of cuisine. Food transcends the barrier of language and culture, telling a story and bringing people closer with every bite. Immigration and cultural diffusion gave us the privilege of being able to try foods that we would have never been able to taste otheriwse. Have you ever wanted to cook a meal from a cuisine using the ingredients you already have at home? Have you ever been curious about which ingredients certain cuisines use the most in their dishes? If you relate to any of the previous questions, this project may be of intrest to you. 

### Motivation

The problem we were trying to solve with this project was being able to match a recipe to a cuisine based on its ingredients only, more precisely , “Which cuisine does a recipe’s ingredients belong to?”. Apart from food being such a crucial part of our lives, we chose this problem because we both love food and cooking, and thought it was an interesting topic because we knew that there can be a lot of overlap of ingredients in many cuisines, so we wanted to try and attempt to make a model that would help differentiate them. The goal is to be able to predict the category of a dish’s cuisine given a list of its ingredients. We found this idea on Kaggle and thought it would be a fun and interesting way to test if it really is that simple to categorize food based on ingredients only.
